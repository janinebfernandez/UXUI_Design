                            <p>Before initiating my design process, I needed to know what content I want to showcase within my Portfolio. I previously had numerous work samples to include, but soon realized this may have been too overwhelming for my viewers. So, I decided to cut down and prioritize what is important. Having the tools and assets to create all of my content has allowed me to fully craft my website.</p>

                            <h3>Portfolio Sampling</h3>
                            <p>I viewed various portfolios of other creative individuals. I paid close attention to portfolios that specifically piqued my interest. This process was very important because it gave me a sense of direction. Opening myself up to other peoplesâ€™ work has inspired me to create my own.</p>

                            <h3>Exploring Designs</h3>
                            <p>I explored inspirations from my research on a deeper level in order to incorporate them into my work. Being allowed to nitpick what I did and did not want from my portfolio sampling has allowed me to filter my design choices. Some portfolios were too simplistic, others were too excessive in design. Looking at a page shouldn't give you a headache! You should be able to determine what the page is about at first glance; and should be able to easily navigate through it. Ultimately, simplicity and an easy user interface led me to my final design.</p>

                            <p>My portfolio is geared not only towards my design, but also towards front-end development. I want to apply my skills in programming to create new functionalities and designs using HTML, CSS and Javascript. After finalizing the layout, heavy research was needed to make sure the correct code was implemented. My ultimate goal was to design code that is reusable for multiple pages and interfaces. Because I have professional experience with programming, this has helped me tremendously, especially in terms of knowing where to look for necessary resources.</p>

                            <p>The main tools that I utilized in this project are Photoshop, Visual Studio Code, and Git Hub. I also took some time to take photos and incorporate them into the design; thus, adding my own personal touch. I used each tool depending on the needs of the website in order to meet the goals I had for a successful portfolio.</p>

On the other hand, an individual who knows nothing about the website will likely find something that doesn't work well for them on the page, such as: washed out colors, poor text visibility, a broken button, and so on. Having someone else walk through my final portfolio helped me determine what needs to be changed to further improve my work.</p>

As my knowledge within this field expands I'm sure one day I'll decide to redesign my portfolio again. Whether it be to accomodate more work samples or simply apply a fresh new design, one thing that never changes is the process; plan, design, and execute. Two key takeaways I got from this project is to stay consitant and always educate yourself. Staying consistant allows you to produce results that best represent you while continuing to educate yourself lets you step outside of your comfort zone allowing you to grow your skills.  </div>
